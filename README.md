The utsf package provides an engine for univariate time series
forecasting using different regression models in an autoregressive way.
The engine provides an uniform interface for applying the different
models. Furthermore, it is extensible so that users can easily apply
their own regression models to univariate time series forecasting and
benefit from all the features of the engine, such as preprocessings or
estimation of forecast accuracy.

## Installation

You can install the development version of utsf from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("franciscomartinezdelrio/utsf")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(utsf)
# Forecast the next 12 future values of time series UKDriverDeaths using random forest
m <- create_model(UKDriverDeaths, method = "rf")
f <- forecast(m, h = 12)
f$pred # to see the forecast
#>           Jan      Feb      Mar      Apr      May      Jun      Jul      Aug
#> 1985 1310.838 1238.733 1225.454 1179.955 1272.244 1260.304 1324.537 1346.230
